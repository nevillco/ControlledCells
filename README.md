# ControlledCells

This is a demo project on how to make `UIViewController`-backed `UITableViewCell`s. Does not require subclassing `UITableViewCell`, and gives access to the full set of  `UIViewController` lifecycle functions. The `ControlledCells.xcworkspace` file can be opened and ran. Any Cocoapods installed are for reducing boilerplate; a dependency-less version could be easily made.
